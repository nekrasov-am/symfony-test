The url [https://api.exchangeratesapi.io/latest](https://api.exchangeratesapi.io/latest) in the example is not working anymore and had to be replaced with [https://api.apilayer.com/exchangerates_data/latest](https://api.apilayer.com/exchangerates_data/latest). It requires API key from [https://apilayer.com/marketplace/exchangerates_data-api](https://apilayer.com/marketplace/exchangerates_data-api) that has to be set in the environment variable `EXCHANGE_API_KEY` in `.env` file.
